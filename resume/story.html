    <h2>Ship Life</h2>
    <h3>Jan 2001 - Nov 2001</h3>
    <p>Following high school and a few college courses I wanted to get out and see the world.  I joined the twelve member crew of the White Holly and was tasked with bringing a ship from Virginia to the Marshall Islands. It was going to be a medical christian missionary ship for islanders.  The journey taught me leadership, discipline and dedication.</p>

    <p>After a year of extreme discipline I was prepared to get a degree. Now with a new curiosity about religions, I enrolled in seminary.   I felt ministry would be my calling.   After serving in the ministry for a short while I decide the pulpit wasn’t where my interest and talent lay. </p>

    <p>While I was in seminary I wanted to do something useful with my spring and winter breaks so I began organizing domestic service trips.  I organized and lead multiple teams of students to different cities to do service for others. One such trip was helping residents rebuild their lives after Hurricane Katrina.</p>
