Interactive Resume

Developing a new type of interactive resume. I hope to display a resume on the left hand side hovering over a world map.
The world map will have pins that corresponds to job positions.  As a site user scrolls over different job positions it
the map will zoom to those locations.  The site will also have a way to display portfolio of work from each position. 
Also there needs to be a pop out business card with vcard capability. 

I plan on writing this myself, but if you could teach me a few things then you are welcome to help.
