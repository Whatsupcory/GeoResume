Interactive Resume

Demo at <a href="http://www.corymacvie.com">CoryMacVie.com</a>

Developing a new type of interactive resume. I hope to display a resume on the left hand side hovering over a world map.
The world map will have pins that corresponds to job positions.  As a site user scrolls over different job positions in
the map will zoom to those locations.  The site will also have a way to display portfolio of work from each position. 
Also there needs to be a pop out business card with vcard capability. 

I plan on writing this myself, but if you could teach me a few things or have ideas on how to improve it then you are welcome to help.  All is welcome.
